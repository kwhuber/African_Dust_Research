For Linux 64, Open MPI is built with CUDA awareness but this support is disabled by default.
To enable it, please set the environment variable OMPI_MCA_opal_cuda_support=true before
launching your MPI processes. Equivalently, you can set the MCA parameter in the command line:
mpiexec --mca opal_cuda_support 1 ...
 
In addition, the UCX support is also built but disabled by default.
To enable it, first install UCX (conda install -c conda-forge ucx). Then, set the environment
variables OMPI_MCA_pml="ucx" OMPI_MCA_osc="ucx" before launching your MPI processes.
Equivalently, you can set the MCA parameters in the command line:
mpiexec --mca pml ucx --mca osc ucx ...
Note that you might also need to set UCX_MEMTYPE_CACHE=n for CUDA awareness via UCX.
Please consult UCX's documentation for detail.

      Building freetype in build/freetype-2.6.1
      
      FreeType build system -- automatic system detection
      
      The following settings are used:
      
        platform                    unix
        compiler                    cc
        configuration directory     ./builds/unix
        configuration rules         ./builds/unix/unix.mk
      
      If this does not correspond to your system or settings please remove the file
      `config.mk' from this directory then read the INSTALL file for help.
      
      Otherwise, simply type `make' again to build the library,
      or `make refdoc' to build the API reference (this needs python >= 2.6).
