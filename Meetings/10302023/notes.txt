To Do: 
1. Create individual cells to house the different data sets (each needs a color bar)
2. calculate diff between 
	VIIRS and MEERA
		10 - 00
	VIIRS and EAC4
		11 - 1
	VIIRS NAAPS
		12 - 2

	*in terms of plotting, plot regular VIIRS and respective partner (MEERA, EAC4, NAAPS) with the same color bar used to plot regular AOD (this will be figures 1 and 2) but when plotting their difference (use a different color bar) 


3. Read papers
4. look into xarray and matplotlib
5. look into how satellites work and how different ones can match up



10.30.23

1. Finish color bar errors
2. plot dates correctly
3. find difference (plot satellite, reanalysis, and difference)
	-reanalysis(0-2) minus satellite(10-12)

4. Create a box over land and ocean
5. Plot the relationship between them over the 15 days
	-plot the curves of each dataset over land 
	-plot the curves of each dataset over ocean
	-xarray email Qinjian sent me will detail how to calculate area average (weighted)
