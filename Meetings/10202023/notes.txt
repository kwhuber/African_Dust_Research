1. Why do I have to type $ cd /DATA to get into this database? 

2. How do I create a title for each different set of data? 

3. How do I separate each dataset by a color bar? 

4. In the following directory...
MERRA2 AOD:
/DATA2/reanalysis/MERRA2/tavg1_2d_aer_Nx/00_global, 00_global does not exist so I used raw?
A: Qinjian changed directories

5. for dir_data4 how do I pick just the noon hour time? 
A: done in code

6. Why can't I print ds4?
A: fixed in code

To Do: 
1. Create individual cells to house the different data sets (each needs a color bar)
2. calculate diff between 
	VIIRS and MEERA
		10 - 00
	VIIRS and EAC4
		11 - 1
	VIIRS NAAPS
		12 - 2

	*in terms of plotting, plot regular VIIRS and respective partner (MEERA, EAC4, NAAPS) with the same color bar used to plot regular AOD (this will be figures 1 and 2) but when plotting their difference (use a different color bar) 


3. Read papers
4. look into xarray and matplotlib
5. look into how satellites work and how different ones can match up 

MODIS (1999) older
VIIRS  (2012)  newer
